    From Detectron2, point_features.py#19

    A wrapper around :function:`torch.nn.functional.grid_sample` to support 3D point_coords tensors.
    Unlike :function:`torch.nn.functional.grid_sample` it assumes `point_coords` to lie inside
    [0, 1] x [0, 1] square.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, C, H, W) that contains features map on a H x W grid.
        point_coords (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, P, 2) or (N, Hgrid, Wgrid, 2) that contains
        [0, 1] x [0, 1] normalized point coordinates.

    Returns:
        output (Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, C, P) or (N, C, Hgrid, Wgrid) that contains
            features for points in `point_coords`. The features are obtained via bilinear
            interplation from `input` the same way as :function:`torch.nn.functional.grid_sample`.
